## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Working on this challenge helped me practice and improve:
- Writing semantic and accessible HTML
- Using Tailwind CSS utility classes to build responsive layouts
- Creating custom Tailwind configurations, such as extending themes for breakpoints and customizing fonts and colors
- Creating reusable styles for a component

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue building my Tailwind CSS skills. This challenge helped me feel more confident using utility classes for layout and spacing, but I’d like to go further by:
- Structuring more complex, scalable layouts
- Taking full advantage of Tailwind’s responsive design utilities
- Improving the consistency and maintainability of utility-first CSS in larger projects
